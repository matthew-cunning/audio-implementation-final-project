# audio-implementation-final-project-scripts
Final project for audio implementation course. Featuring custom C# scripts for implementing audio in Unity project using Wwise.

These are C# scripts created by me to implement audio in my final project using the Wwise middleware API.

Of particular interest is the RaycastFootsteps script which checks the type of material underneath the player's current position to determine which foostep sound to switch to.
